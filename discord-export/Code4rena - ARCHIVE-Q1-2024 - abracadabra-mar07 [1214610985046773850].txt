Yeah I've done it now. I thought it was always there on c4 but maybe not


[03/08/2024 14:30] kartoonjoy
You arent wrong. We will normally have the file. Thanks for the flexibility.


[03/08/2024 16:16] saint6704
where are the automated findings from bots?


[03/08/2024 16:16] sp1cymeatball
So there is the BlastOnboarding contract where people lock their tokens, when the time comes owner will set it's state to close and change the implementation to BlastOnboardingBoot?


[03/08/2024 16:44] kartoonjoy
You don't see it linked?


[03/08/2024 17:28] saint6704
I can see ` 4naly3er` report but can't see report from bot race


[03/08/2024 17:29] kartoonjoy
There was no bot race for this one.

[03/08/2024 17:54] 0xcalibur
It's a problem with your blast rpc


[03/08/2024 17:54] 0xcalibur
(most likely)


[03/08/2024 17:54] aamirusmani1552
I used it from thirdweb. It's not available on infura I think.


[03/08/2024 17:55] 0xcalibur
quicknode and ankr provides blast rpc with full archive support


[03/08/2024 17:55] aamirusmani1552
oh. let me check


[03/08/2024 17:58] aamirusmani1552
Still same issue


[03/08/2024 17:58] aamirusmani1552
Used ankr rpc


[03/08/2024 19:12] 0xcalibur
Yeah so it's really a RPC issue, try to print it in the test to verify it's using the right one but normally you set it in .env


[03/08/2024 19:13] 0xcalibur
this is what I have in my .env

To everyone, LockingMultiRewards is definitely meant to be used ERC20 tokens, we didn't think about anything else as a standard really. Just meticulously chosen reward tokens here like ARB (arbitrum), SPELL
